# matriculationWeb
Web dev project created for my Matriculation in May 2023. Uses Google Maps API and connects to a MongoDB database to serve content.
NodeJS was used for the server, the Axios library was also utilised to easily send and process requests with the database. The app was designed with Figma and then created in HTML+CSS with Bootstrap as a framework to help around with responsiveness.
Not functional as the server is not always online, but it would be accessible through the index page located in the FRONT/ folder.
